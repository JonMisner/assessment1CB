  ## Description

    Assessment 1 of 3 for CallBox. Create A Staff Page using only HTML and CSS. There were four different staff departments provided, as well as 1-3 emplyees for each department. Using HTML and CSS grids I created a basic fromework. I then styled it using more pure CSS into a "card" format to make it a little easier on the eye.
